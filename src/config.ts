export const EMAIL_BODY = `Dear Town Officials,

I am writing to express my concern about the planned renovation of Griggs Park. While I support improving our community spaces, I urge you to select a contractor who will keep portions of the park open during construction.

Griggs Park is a vital community resource that residents depend on daily. A complete closure would significantly impact families, children, dog owners, and all who rely on this green space.

I respectfully request that the Town of Brookline prioritize contractors who commit to phased construction, closing only one section at a time while keeping the rest accessible.

Thank you for considering the needs of our community.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]`;
